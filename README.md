# Funk_notes (Rust)

This implementation is my rust reworking as a means of learning rust. I'll update this as I make some decent progress.

## TODO:

There's so much to do. But I'll just list what is on my mind now.

1. Set out notes so that you add items to the notes (check the base note format).
2. Implement the delete command.
3. Implement the primary note feature.
